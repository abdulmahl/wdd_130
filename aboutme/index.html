    <p>Hello all, please allow me to introduce myself, I'm married to my best friend and eternal companion, Louisa, and we have one child, Sire, who is now a couple of months old. I'm from Pretoria, Mamelodi, South Africa. I have lived here my whole life. I love it here, but it would be great if my family and I could move to a quieter,  less crowded place.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church since May 2016. My wife only joined a little later (2019). We love serving others and doing our hardest to keep God's commandments. We have been civilly married since October 2019 and got sealed in April 2022. I serve as a ward clerk, the calling is great for me because I get to learn about each member and how to help them.</p>
    <p>I work as a hoist operator. Working for an automotive company has also been a great blessing, I have been able to care for my family's needs, it may not be my ideal job, but since I have enrolled with byu-i, I know that I can better my chances of getting gainful employment, and be able to better care for my family, before I even graduate.</p>
