                <p>A dedicated pool of funds and effective leadership by some larger economies are needed for a successful implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a Ghanaian expert has said.
                Senior Director, Research and Policy Engagement at the African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET) Edward Brown told Xinhua in a recent interview that the experience from the Regional Economic Commissions (RECs) showed that the absence of a dedicated fund to drive economic integration activities was a major difficulty in successful implementation.
                “The lack of a dedicated fund has been a very critical issue with the RECs, so if the AfCFTA is going to work, it would have to consider putting together a dedicated fund that drives this inter-country agenda,” Brown said.
                Therefore, he urged the secretariat commissioned in Ghanaian capital Accra to spend some time in identifying and addressing capacity constraints at national levels, as well as putting in place supporting organizations needed for the effective implementation of the AfCFTA.</p>
