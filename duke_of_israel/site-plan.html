      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hey there! My name is M.Abdul Mahlangu and I'm a web and computer programming student at Brigham Young University-Idaho through (BYU Pathway Worldwide). I'm currently looking for an internship in any of these fields, web frontend developer, junior JavaScript developer, or junior programmer. The ideal internship would be related to my major (Applied Technology), but if it's not related to my major, that's fine too! I'm looking for an internship that will allow me to work with a company or individual that has a website or other software applications. You can check out some of my projects on [https://duke4coco.github.io/wdd_130/].</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <h3>I love to create content that's relatable and engaging, but also informative! </h3>
      <p>I have always been fascinated with compiuters, but I didn't start coding until I was in high school. When I did, it became clear that it is something that interested me, now it has become my passion.</p>  <!-- change this -->
